### Spring Security Learning Documentation
1. [Tutorial 1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bB6A490Uh5M)  : This video was not successful, but it did provide a foundation
2. [Tutorial 2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E6P7V5vvkus)  : This video was not successful, but it did provide a foundation
3. [Tutorial 3](https://studygyaan.com/spring-boot/login-register-example-using-spring-boot) : This was the most helpful tutorial and was the first one that configured an authentication provider DAO. This one has code to create an admin user as well, which could be useful in the future. Features deprecated code though. 
4. [Tutorial 4](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/spring_security/spring_security_form_login_with_database.htm) : This was also helpful, but also uses deprecated code in securityconfig. 
5. Beyond that, hitting cmd+k on classes and fn+f1 on methods and variables opens the actual java documentation and helps get the most recent info and demo configurations. This helps find demo code to get around the deprecated code examples in the tutorials. 
6. Add `logging.level.org.springframework.security=DEBUG` to application.properties to get a more verbose console output while configuring security, it will show errors better than without
